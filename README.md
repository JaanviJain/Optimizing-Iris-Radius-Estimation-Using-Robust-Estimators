# Optimizing-Iris-Radius-Estimation-Using-Robust-Estimators
Optimized iris recognition using robust estimators (Mean, Trimmed Mean, Huber, Midmean) and varied angular sampling (6 &amp; 8 angles). Midmean at 8 angles gave best stability, 20% quality gain. Huber handled outliers best. Improves iris normalization and recognition accuracy.
